 Further description to be added at a later date.



## Setup
 The unity project must have MRTK set up. The installation wizard can be found [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/develop/unity/welcome-to-mr-feature-tool).

 Under MRFT packages, download the following:
* mixed reality toolkit -> mixed reality toolkit foundations
* platform support -> mixed reality OpenXR plugin

 Build platform must be set to UWP. ARM64 architecture must be chosen.
 
 
 ## How to use the program
 As the program is not yet finished, there is no interaction to be listed here. When the project has matured, it is planned to have a grabbable and draggable point that can be placed at a desired point. This point will have child nodes which can have bloom activated for them by a set of parameters. Details will be listed here at a further date.
